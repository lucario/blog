## [Curbside Thai](https://www.riolu.com/ist226/html01/tutorial/ct_start.html)
> Sajja Adulet is the owner and master chef of Curbside Thai, a restaurant owner and now food truck vendor in Charlotte, North Carolina that specializes in Thai dishes. Sajja has hired you to develop the company’s website. The website will display information about Curbside Thai including the truck’s daily locations, menu, catering opportunities, and contact information. Sajja wants the pages to convey the message that customers will get the same great food and service whether they order in the restaurant or from the food truck. Some of the materials for these pages have already been completed by a former employee and Sajja needs you to finish the job by converting that work into a collection of web page documents. To complete this task, you’ll learn how to write and edit HTML5 code and how to get your HTML files ready for display on the World Wide Web.
